# AdieuCoin : Vacay NFT 

![crowd](Images/logo.png)

## We Created a dual-sync / one-chain NFT 

Both for property owners ("owners") as well as Vacationers ("renters"). 

<u> Vacay ! </U>

<u>***Mint as your go***</u> tokenomics ensure that both owners and renters have unique NFT Tokens to add to their collection when renting unique and fun properties.
This is the first working blockchain ERC721 implementation of bi-directional; 100% on-chain renting completely cutting out the "middleman" problem ENTIRELY.
Renters and Owners communicate, interact, and transact directly.  

The Adieu platform is NOT a middleman or party; rather a hosting entity that prefers everything (when possible) be written and transacted ON the blockchain. Adieu does not have ownership, management, oversight, or any control whatsoever once contracts deploy on Mainnet. 


## Inital Parameters: 
***Balance*** We had to choose between convenience, feasibility, timing, and advanced features with limitations on all of the foregoing. 
Even so, a balanced approach and leveraging 4 members in our group, we were able to set initial parameters as follows 

* ERC 721 Standard
* NFT Token 
* 4 contracts within the body of deployment 
* 2 governance/management contracts 
* 2 payload contracts (1 token per contract) 
* 1 governance contract : oversees OWNER functions 
* 1 governance contract : oversees RENTER functions 
* IPFS - used as "side-chain" back-end augmenter *not everything should be on the blockchain* 
* React.JS package - deployed as front-end to 

  * add listings 
  * update listings 
  * price, shop, and rent
